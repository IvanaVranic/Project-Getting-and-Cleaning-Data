In the "subject_activity_mean" dataset there are the following columns:
1) "subject", which is a id of the participants in the experiment. Values are integers from 1 to 30.
2) "activity", which is the description of the activity the subject performed. The values are characters: laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking_downstairs and walking_upstairs.
3) The rest of the columns represent the means of the measurements of a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables for each activity and each subject. The values are numeric.

The process for creating this dataset is described in the readme.md file
